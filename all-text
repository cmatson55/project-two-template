From Leafly
This was by far the best experience that my caregiver and myself have had at a dispensary. When you walk in you can see all of the hard work and dedication they have put in to this place. The ladies will make you feel right at home with their knowledge and compassion for making sure you get the right medicine. Top notch flowers and great people! Our new regular go-to! The new Bloom! Go check-em out!
